# Python-Learning
The purpose of this repository is to catalog my progress for future reflection, and proof of practice. 

This repository began with Dr. Severance's PY4E (Python for Everyone) online class. It is free and publicly available, and if you would like to learn Python too, I highly
recommend the course.

Thank you for reading this, have a wonderful day.
